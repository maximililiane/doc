We are proud to release Elektra 0.\+9.$<$$<$\+V\+E\+R\+S\+I\+O\+N$>$$>$.

Elektra serves as a universal and secure framework to access configuration settings in a global, hierarchical key database. For more information, visit \href{https://libelektra.org}{\tt https\+://libelektra.\+org}.

\item Important Changes to Keynames
\item Debian and Fedora Packaging with C\+Pack
\item $<$$<$\+H\+I\+G\+H\+L\+I\+G\+H\+T3$>$$>$
\end{DoxyItemize}

There have been significant changes to Elektra\textquotesingle{}s Keynames.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The most important change is that you now need a {\ttfamily \+:} after the namespace. So instead of {\ttfamily system/elektra/version} you have to use {\ttfamily system\+:/elektra/version}.
\item The second big change is to array elements. From now on {\ttfamily key\+New (\char`\"{}/array/\#10\char`\"{}, K\+E\+Y\+\_\+\+E\+ND)} will create a {\ttfamily Key} with name {\ttfamily /array/\#\+\_\+10}, to make arrays more user-\/friendly while preserving numerical ordering.
\item The whole internal implementation for {\ttfamily key\+Set\+Name}, {\ttfamily key\+Add\+Name}, etc. has been completely rewritten. If you rely on specific behaviour of Elektra\textquotesingle{}s Keynames and have already taken the two changes above into account, please refer to the newly created \hyperlink{doc_KEYNAMES_md}{Keyname documentation} and Python reference implementation.
\item Metakeys now use the namespace {\ttfamily meta\+:/}. The accessor function {\ttfamily key\+Get\+Meta} and {\ttfamily key\+Set\+Meta} automatically add this namespace to preserve compatibility. However, if you use the recently introduced {\ttfamily key\+Meta} or otherwise directly access the keyname of a metakey, you will have to update your code.
\item {\ttfamily default\+:/} is a new namespace used for keys that exist purely to represent a default value (e.\+g. generated by the {\ttfamily spec} plugin).

Looking up cascading keys with {\ttfamily ks\+Lookup} now looks at namespaces in the following order\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily proc\+:/}
\item {\ttfamily dir\+:/}
\item {\ttfamily user\+:/}
\item {\ttfamily system\+:/}
\item {\ttfamily default\+:/}
\item {\ttfamily /} (cascading key itself)
\end{DoxyItemize}

The final lookup of the cascading key itself, will be removed in a future release. Please update your code to generate {\ttfamily default\+:/} keys, if you rely on this feature.

Note\+: The {\ttfamily spec} plugin already generates {\ttfamily default\+:/} keys.
\item The function {\ttfamily key\+Inactive} has been removed. The concept of inactive keys no longer exists, use \href{/home/jenkins/workspace/libelektra-release-pipeline-testing/doc/METADATA.ini}{\tt comment/\#} instead.
\item {\ttfamily Elektra\+Namespace} is the new C++ {\ttfamily enum class} for the Elektra\textquotesingle{}s namespaces. You should prefer it to using {\ttfamily K\+E\+Y\+\_\+\+N\+S\+\_\+\+S\+Y\+S\+T\+EM} et al. directly, if you use C++.
\item {\ttfamily key\+Get\+Full\+Name} et al. have been removed. The concept of a \char`\"{}full name (with owner)\char`\"{} no longer exists.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Updates since initial PR\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix combining dot-\/dot parts and escapes in key names. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item Fix adding more than 10 warnings to a key. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

The change to key names breaks existing mountpoint configurations.

It is not hard to fix the mountpoint configs even after the updating to the new version.

There are two places that will still contain the old syntax after the update\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Every key below (and including) {\ttfamily system\+:/elektra/mountpoints/$<$M\+O\+U\+N\+T\+P\+O\+I\+NT$>$} uses an old key names as {\ttfamily $<$M\+O\+U\+N\+T\+P\+O\+I\+NT$>$}, if the mountpoint was created with {\ttfamily kdb mount}.
\item The value of all keys matching {\ttfamily system\+:/elektra/mountpoints/$\ast$/mountpoint} must be valid key names.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Fixing the first instance is optional. There the key name is just used to create a unique name for the mountpoint.

The second instance, however, must be fixed or Elektra will be unusable.

{\bfseries Disclaimer\+:} We cannot guarantee that the commands below work for all cases. We also make no guarantees that the command will not break things.

{\itshape You have been warned. Manually backup important data first.} \end{quote}


To fix both the {\ttfamily system\+:/elektra/mountpoints/$\ast$/mountpoint} values and the {\ttfamily system\+:/elektra/mountpoints/$<$M\+O\+U\+N\+T\+P\+O\+I\+NT$>$} names, you can use the following command.


\begin{DoxyCode}
kdb upgrade pr3555 names values
\end{DoxyCode}


If you just want to fix the {\ttfamily system\+:/elektra/mountpoints/$\ast$/mountpoint} values, but keep the old syntax for the mountpoint names, you can use this script\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
kdb upgrade pr3555 values
\end{DoxyCode}


\begin{quote}
{\itshape Note\+:} The original {\ttfamily system\+:/elektra/mountpoints} data will be moved to {\ttfamily system\+:/elektra/mountpoints-\/backup} \end{quote}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We are now using C\+Pack to generate modular Debian and Ubuntu packages. This simplifies the packaging process and solves problems where a PR that introduces changes to installed files, fails. We can now also set distribution specifc dependencies with C\+Pack, which is needed for some packages. \+\_\+(\+Robert Sowula)\+\_\+
\item We now also generate R\+PM packages for Fedora. \+\_\+(\+Robert Sowula)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}

We removed the {\ttfamily ini} plugin (superseded by the T\+O\+ML plugin), the {\ttfamily null} plugin (superseded by the base64 plugin) and the {\ttfamily tcl} plugin \+\_\+(\+Markus Raab, Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+

The following section lists news about the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/plugins/readme}{\tt modules} we updated in this release.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fix rare memleak when the {\ttfamily jni} plugin is closed. \+\_\+(Mihael Pranjić)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We changed the {\ttfamily provides} clause in the plugin contract. Now m\+I\+NI offers support for the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties}{\tt properties format} ({\ttfamily storage/properties}) instead of the I\+NI file format ({\ttfamily storage/ini}). This makes sense, since the plugin never supported the \href{https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#Sections}{\tt section syntax} of I\+NI files. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Support for the old quickdump v1 and v2 formats has been removed. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The plugin contract now correctly states that the plugin offers support for the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties}{\tt properties format}. Before it would state that the plugin offered support for the I\+NI file format. This is not true, since the plugin does not support the \href{https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file#Sections}{\tt section syntax} of the I\+NI file format.
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We fixed an \href{https://issues.libelektra.org/3561}{\tt use after free bug in the plugin}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The plugin now works (with and) requires \href{https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/releases/tag/4.9}{\tt A\+N\+T\+LR {\ttfamily 4.\+9}}. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+

The text below summarizes updates to the \href{https://www.libelektra.org/libraries/readme}{\tt C (and C++)-\/based libraries} of Elektra.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We removed the fallback procedure introduced in Elektra 0.\+8.\+15 (using {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+D\+B\+\_\+\+F\+I\+LE} ({\ttfamily default.\+ecf}) for {\ttfamily system\+:/elektra}, if the bootstrap backend {\ttfamily K\+D\+B\+\_\+\+D\+B\+\_\+\+I\+N\+IT} ({\ttfamily elektra.\+ecf}) isn\textquotesingle{}t found). If you still rely on this feature, either use {\ttfamily kdb upgrade-\/bootstrap} {\bfseries before} upgrading, or manually extract {\ttfamily system\+:/elektra} into {\ttfamily elektra.\+ecf}.
\item There was an internal update to how warnings are generated. For users this means that the {\ttfamily warnings} metadata now forms a proper array. Specifically, the first 100 warnings are stored below to the meta keys {\ttfamily warnings/\#0}, {\ttfamily warnings/\#1}, ..., {\ttfamily warnings/\#9}, {\ttfamily warnings/\#\+\_\+10}, ..., {\ttfamily warnings/\#\+\_\+99}. After that, warnings will wrap around, so the 101st warning will be stored as {\ttfamily warnings/\#0}, no. 102 as {\ttfamily warnings/\#1} etc.
\item $<$$<$\+T\+O\+D\+O$>$$>$
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily kdb\+Set} now properly handles, if the given {\ttfamily parent\+Key} is {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL} or has read-\/only name, value or metadata. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+
\item $<$$<$\+T\+O\+D\+O$>$$>$

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Removed {\ttfamily elektra\+Key\+Get\+Meta\+Key\+Set} and moved {\ttfamily key\+Set\+StringF} to the hosts plugin. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+
\item Removed {\ttfamily ks\+Pop\+At\+Cursor}. \+\_\+(\+Philipp Gackstatter)\+\_\+

Bindings allow you to utilize Elektra using \href{https://www.libelektra.org/bindings/readme}{\tt various programming languages}. This section keeps you up to date with the multi-\/language support provided by Elektra.


\begin{DoxyItemize}

\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed allocation not correctly conveyed on key set initialization \+\_\+(\+Michael Tucek)\+\_\+
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Elektra\+Namespace} is the new C++ {\ttfamily enum class} for the Elektra\textquotesingle{}s namespaces. You should prefer it to using {\ttfamily K\+E\+Y\+\_\+\+N\+S\+\_\+\+S\+Y\+S\+T\+EM} et al. directly, if you use C++. The array {\ttfamily E\+L\+E\+K\+T\+R\+A\+\_\+\+N\+A\+M\+E\+S\+P\+A\+C\+ES} can be used to iterate over all namespaces. \+\_\+(Klemens Böswirth)\+\_\+

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We now use Debian sid to build the documentation instead of Debian stretch. The Doxygen version in Debian stretch \href{https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen/issues/6456}{\tt contains a bug} that causes the generation of the P\+DF documentation to fail. \+\_\+(René Schwaiger)\+\_\+
